# Postman Galaxy 2020 - API First Training

This directory includes supporting resources for the API First training session at Postman Galaxy 2020! During the session you're going to work through generating collections from an API specification file that you'll import and edit.

To get started, open the [customers](customers.yaml) file and download it. In Postman navigate to **APIs** and create a new API. Enter 'Customers' as the name, '1.0' as the version, and import your downloaded spec file.
